Spam detection

Problem : Creating a Random Forest model usig SPAM dataset

Data: This dataset contain one message per line. Each line is composed by two columns: v1 contains the label (ham or spam) and v2 contains the raw text.

Solution: The Spam Detection model is built to classify emails or messages as either spam or not spam. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the model preprocesses text data by tokenization, removing stop words, and vectorizing. The notebook provides end-to-end implementation, including data cleaning, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. The model can be customized and extended for different spam detection tasks.
